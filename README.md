Interview Questions

In order to run the code on people.ipynb and acquistion_facts.ipynb, I used jupyter note and ran the code from there.

The 3 files 'con.csv', 'cons_email.csv', and 'cons_email_chapter_subscription.csv' must be in the same folder as people.ipynb in order for people.ipynb to run properly.

people.ipynb when run will produce the people.csv file which include the header columns: email, code, isunsub, created_dt, and updated_dt.

acquisition_facts.ipynb when run will produce the acquisition_facts.csv file which include the header columns: acquisition_date, and acquisitions.

people.csv is the data frame that is created after completing Data Engineer Exercise 1.

acquisition_facts.csv is the data frame that is created after completing Data Engineer Exercise 2.

Client Communications - Data Engineer.docx is the summary of the work that was completed in Exercises 1 and 2 for the intended audience of a client.

Analytics.xlsx is the excel spreadsheet that presents the results of the 3 email's statistics.

Analytics - Spreadsheet Results.docx includes the answers to the follow up questions for the spreadsheet.
